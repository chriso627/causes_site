There's absolutely no point writing sample letters asking for tuition assistance if you don't have anyone to send them to! Before you start to write sample letters asking for tuition assistance take the time to do some research, create a spreadsheet and on the tabs clearly mark millionaires, churches, charities and government grants. Under each tab find 10 people or organisations to write to and then list their contact details. Keeping track of who you contact will really help you contact as many people as possible for money and maximise your chances of getting a lot of money. Strategise and have tactics in place before you write sample letters asking for tuition assistance.</p>

<p class="rightside"> Sample Letter Asking for Tuition Assistance: <br>Is a hand written letter better or an email?

In my humble opinion it is best way to contact millionaires, charities, churches and government bodies for money is by writing hand written letters, hand writing sample letters asking for financial assistance is the best way to go for sure. You will not come up with a masterpiece when you attempt your first sample letters asking for tuition assistance, after your second or third draft you will be able to put on paper exactly what you feel and explain how the money will really help you financially flourish. Remember to appeal to the heart of the people who give financial assistance. </p>
